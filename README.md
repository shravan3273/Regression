In order for a health insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneficiaries.As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money in developing models that accurately forecast medical expenses for insured population.


Medical expenses are difficult to estimate because the most costly conditions are rare and seemingly random. Still, some condition are more prevalent for certain segments of the population. For instance, ling cancer is more likely among smokers than non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese.


The goal of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care expenses for such population segments. These estimates can be used to create acturial tables that set the price of yearly premiums higher or lower, depending on the expected treatment costs.


For this analysis, we will use a simulated dataset containing hypothetical medical expenses for patients in the United States.


The insurance file consist of 1338 examples of beneficiaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating characteristics of the patient as well as the total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calender year.
